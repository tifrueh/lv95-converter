# LV95-converter

`lv95-converter` is a command line tool used to convert Swiss LV95 coordinates to WGS84 and vice-versa. The formulas used are the ones provided by [Swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/home.html) as described in their document [Formulas and constants for the calculation of the Swiss conformal cylindrical projection and for the transformation between coordinate systems](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/content/swisstopo-internet/en/online/calculation-services/_jcr_content/contentPar/tabs/items/documents_publicatio/tabPar/downloadlist/downloadItems/20_1467104436749.download/refsys_e.pdf). To parse the command-line arguments [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11) by [CLIUtils](https://github.com/CLIUtils) was used.

## Installation

To install `lv95-converter` you can either build it from source or download a binary from the latest release.

### Building from source

1. Download the latest tarball and extract it.
2. Execute `make` from inside the source directory. <br> 
   The build process can be influenced using the following environment variables: <br>
   `CXX`: the c++ compiler to be used <br>
   `CPPFLAGS`: preprocessor options <br>
   `CXXFLAGS`: compiler options <br>
   `LDFLAGS`: linker options
3. Execute `make install` to install the binary built during the previous step. The install location can be changed by setting the environment variable `DESTDIR`.


## Usage

To convert LV95 to WGS84 pass the `lv95` subcommand to the program and use the `-e` and the `-n` flag respectively to input LV95 coordinates.

To convert WGS84 to LV95 pass the `wgs84` subcommand to the program and use the `-n` and the `-e` flag respectively to input WGS84 coordinates.
